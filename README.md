The Comm Build System and Configuration for use with Unified XUL Platform projects

## How to setup a basic UXP project or fork there of
All you have to do is place the application directory at the top level and add a git submodule to the Unified XUL Platform attached to the `platform/` directory.

Specific application development will be documented as time permits, however, if you have any questions you can ask on the Pale Moon forums in the UXP Development board or head to #binaryoutcast on the Freenode IRC Network. I would be glad to help you.

**NOTE: This repository is not required to build any UXP application currently produced by Moonchild Productions, Binary Outcast, or the Hyperbola Project. It is merely a fresh starting position for new applications or unifing repositories for forks of current applications!**
